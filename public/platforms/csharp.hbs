       <p>My C# endeavour came naturally after the acquaintance with C and C++.
         Most of the practice and knowledge I've gathered are related to C# version 4.0,
         with the exception of few items I've learned from newer versions.

         It was a kind of fun to build tasks both in C++ and C#,
         comparing approaches and performace results.
       </p>

       <p>I will try to keep track of my C# projects <a href="../projects/csharp_projects.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
