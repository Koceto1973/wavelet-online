       <p>As apps and projects grew, 
          the need for efficient version control came to me naturally. 
          So I started using it locally first, experimenting more freely with code, 
          and then switched to GitHub as shared online storage. 
          After the usual initial flirting with UIs for Windows desktop,
          Mac desktop and Xcode( integrated source control), it became clear that
          instead of learning too many UI stuff with limited functionality,
          it would be better to stick with the Git terminal/shell,
          and enjoy the full power of this cleverly designed VCS.
       </p>      

       <p>Working with the system, I gathered experience
           with the most fundamental tasks, such as: installing git,
           setting up the environment, creating and cloning project both to
           and from server, managing untracked, unmodified, modified and staged areas,
           working with branches, merging and rebasing, amending and reverting commits,
           SSH server access, couple of strategies for managing projects, etc.

           where I will try to upload most of my code.</p>
