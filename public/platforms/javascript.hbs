       <p>After some time spent touching this script language from here and there,
         the right time came to bring on board the missing third one from the holly tripple Front-End herd.
         <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/" target="_blank">This</a> was my choice as
         a starter JS course to cement the foundations. It was a fast pace, well accenting on corner stones
         lecturing combined with interesting projects. Then I took
         <a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank">another</a>
         course, giving myself a better undestanding of JS wierd stuff and internals of the JS language.</p>

         <p>Projecting my curiousity over to the server side,
         <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/" target="_blank">this</a>
         was the first Node.js course I enrolled.
       </p>

       <p>I will try to keep track of my JS/ Node.js projects <a href="../projects/javascript_projects.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

       <p>Here are the training completion certificates :</p>
       <p><a href="https://udemy-certificate.s3.amazonaws.com/image/UC-NCKFCP6X.jpg" target="_blank">JS certificate 1</a></p>
